## Planning, Process & Problem-solving

We planned our project using user stories, an ERD diagram and a wireframe.
We then made a list of to-dos for the back end as well as the front end.
We randomly chose a leader for each day to spearhead the operations and each person took on either the front end or the back end.
When we ran into an issue that we were not familiar with, we all grouped back together to attack the problem. This allowed
us all to learn and contribute our possible solutions.
We made it a point to slack out a message each time we made a pull request in order to alert our teammates that they would need to pull down the latest development branch.
